# Acing the Interview

> Questions, comments or ideas on how we can make this document better? Your contributions to this doc are very much appreciated.

## Overview

This document represents a collection of best practices and behind the scenes sneak peaks into the hiring interview that focuses on your behaviour / soft skills as well as general communication / team work abilities. 

This bundle was created based on our notes, reviews and performance of previous candidates and encapsulates best practices as well as a step by step guide in how to present the best version of yourself.

## The 3 stages of the interview "lifecycle”

**Intro**: Interviews are more than just that meeting/phone call you have scheduled for "Monday at 10am”. A great process starts early - with a thorough research on that opportunity (stage 1) - by assessing the company's size, values, vision & products. Are those in tune with your ambitions and strengths? The next step is the actual interview where a strong personal story and an effective pitch set the right tone for a meaningful conversation that will send you straight to the short list. However, it does not end there - be that person that follows up - thanking your interviewer for its time and touching on some key topics. More on all of these, below.

### Before the interview

**a) Create a playbook** 

- this will act as a compass for all future interviews. treat it as a living document; constantly iterate add fresh data from new interviews 
- should contain the core ideas you want to communicate about yourself 
- a portfolio section is important to quickly reference your best works and projects.
- make it easy to screen-share and email - **pdfs** work best.

**b) Research the opportunity** 

- learn more about the company, its mission and its key products. how do these overlap with your previous background? 
- research the company's existing technology stack. (look for references on Glassdoor or use services like [datanyze](https://www.datanyze.com/) or [builtwith.com](http://builtwith.com).
- know exactly who you will be talking to; ask the person who reaches out who will join them in evaluating you. look for similar interests, education etc.

**c**) **Define your personal objectives and expected outcome.**

- Is this opportunity aligned with your long term goals. 
- What would an ideal team/organisation look like to you? What are the questions you can ask your interviewers to find that out?

**d) Practice with a friend**

- Role playing interviews is a great way to relieve pressure and iterate on your answers.
- Switch sides with your friend  (be the interviewer and get a sense of what it's like on the other end. 

### The interview 

**Intro**: This part of the interview is designed to get the person in front of you connect with you on an emotional level. There has to be something about you that stands out and creates emotion/connection with your interviewer –  ideally you’d want them excited by the prospect of hiring you or at the very least intrigued.  Depending on the size of the company you are interviewing with the first touch will be  centred around your behaviour & soft skills.  

**a) Lead with your story**

- How/When did you start coding? What was your personal motivation? 
- Highlight the 1/2 achievements you are most proud of. (the most technically complex product you've worked on, its main challenges and how you tacked them) 
- Small things matter a lot: Are you an OSS contributor, worked on hobby projects or for a non-profit cause? Make sure to mention these as well and offer some context around your motivation. 

**b) Key topics that will come up in the interview & how to prepare**

- **Your Learning process:** This applies to coding as well as to any other life situation that would require acquiring new skills to solve a problem. 

   Explain how you learn and apply new skills! Use an example from a former experience to provide context.

- **Your work ethics**: what are the tools & methodologies you use and how do you use them to deliver quality work. (explain a regular work day in a remote setup) 
- **Balancing Leadership and Team Play**: when remote work is at stake you are in a unique position: you have to both act as a leader and master self management skills but also clearly understand your role within your team and cater to the needs of others.

### After the interview

**Intro:**  Less than 5% of all candidates find time or understand the importance of following up with your interviewer, but this simple action is sometimes so powerful that it could fast-track you to the top of the list. Right after your interview, send the recruiter a **followup email.**  This sends a very powerful signal to your recruiter and you will be seen as a person that's a great communicator and reinforces your interest in that opportunity. 

*Email structure:* 

- A quick thank you for taking the time to conduct the interview and for the interviewer’s willingness to answer to all your questions. 

- Share something you feel you’ve learned from that discussion – perhaps some piece of advice or feedback that really stuck to you – if you don’t feel you had that – maybe mention something that you really liked about the prospect of working there or about the company. 

- Review your solutions to the coding questions -  think what you would have done differently – it’s not too late to send an update saying – hey I thought this over even further – I believe there’s a better way to do this by doing so and so.

- If you haven't yet learned about their recruiting process - this is a good time to ask about the next steps. 

Don’t just stop at that 1 follow-up email. Wait for 3-4 days and then follow-up again. Keep this followup short and sweet. Its only purpose is to help you stay top of mind with that team.
