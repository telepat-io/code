# Personal Video Pitch

## Why we do this:
A short introductory video will crown your north profile and help you introduce yourself in the best possible way to any opportunity that might come your way. It’s a lightning-fast and compelling way to get your foot in the door at any occasion.

A 3-5 minute video structured the right way will shine the best possible light on you and your work while delivering a powerful story that can instantly generate rapport with your recruiter and potential new colleagues.

While this activity is not mandatory in Telepat North (we understand some people don’t like filming themselves or sharing that type of video) – it is essential, so for those of you sitting on the edge, we’d strongly encourage you to leap. It will be worth it.

## How to prepare:
1. **Time, Light &amp; Gear**: we recommend shooting this video in strong natural sunlight – perhaps in front of a larger window or even outside if there is no background noise. You can use your laptop webcam or phone to keep things simple. Please avoid as much as possible low light /artificial light conditions.

2. **Energy &amp; Presence**: Being in the right mindset to create. Find a day when you feel you have the right energy, and you feel confident and relaxed (perhaps during a weekend). Your tone of voice and overall delivery
should convey excitement and passion for your work and your higher goals. Smiling while taking under stress doesn’t come naturally – so make sure to remind yourself to accompany your delivery with a smile here and there.

3. **Write down and learn your pitch**: Having a flawless delivery on video implies some practicing beforehand. Our learnings show that the best way to approach this is to build a transcript of your entire message and learn it by heart. This usually takes the longest, but it is by far the method that provides the best output. The next best thing is to have all the core ideas written down and make sure you go through them.

## Your Pitch structure:
1. Introduce yourself by first name and include a one-sentence overview that catches the core of your professional abilities and the total number of years you’ve been a coder.

2. Tell the story of your programming beginnings. Why / How you first started coding? What was your motivation (what fascinated you about this path? Any fun memory worth sharing – do it here (5-10 sentences max)!

3. Explain your evolution: Go through the stages of your career. How did you transition from one technology to another, what is your learning process (7-10 sentences)?

4. Shine some light on your most significant achievement: Sometimes less is more – think about that one product/project that you are the proudest of. Tell its story (10+ sentences). Here are a few support questions that can help you craft that:

    - What was the project/product goals? OSS? Hobby? Work?
    - How did you get involved with it, and what were you responsible for? Think about ways your work /code was instrumental/vital for that particular product/project.
    -  What was the impact of that product/project in its intended market?

5. Paint a vision for your future for a strong ending: Share what a fulfilled professional life would mean to you. Where do you see yourself as being close to excellency? What new areas of technology are you looking to learn, and why? AI, Crypto, IoT are all hot topics nowadays, and if they are on your menu, make sure you are specific about it – what parts of it will you be exploring and how (5-10 sentences).
