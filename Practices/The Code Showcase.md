# The Code Showcase

## Why the Industry Does This

Tech recruiters need some efficient tools to help them properly evaluate candidate skill level, but the best tool for this job is still a very much debated topic. There are, however, some hiring practices that stand out:

- Right after using traditional tools like evaluating CVs and phone or video interviews, hiring managers are most likely to look at a candidate‚Äôs side projects, Github repository, and open source contributions (75%), review their portfolio (56%), and send them a take-home assignment (51%).
- Candidates were mostly like to encounter a take-home assignment (68%), a portfolio review (63%), and a screen share/pair programming session (51%).

When using these evaluation tools, interviewers will be watching out for:

- Your ability to understand the scope of the challenge;
- Your problem-solving skills - hiring managers are nearly [twice as likely](https://clutch.co/hr/resources/what-factors-impact-optimism-about-future-of-work) to value these compared to digital or technical skills;
- Critical thinking;
- The quality and structure of your real-life code;
- Your coding practices - your IDE and plugin setup, code style, documentation and tests;
- Your ability to verbally express your reasoning, your language skills.


## How we do it @North

We‚Äôre re-imagining all of these practices and unifying them into a single Code Showcase session. We‚Äôll help you prepare, record and then edit and attach the best clips of the session to your anonymous North profile. You‚Äôll be in control of who you share this with, and it will give you an edge over most candidates out there, since recruiters will be able to instantly watch you in action.

The objective is to capture your best performance, so it‚Äôs crucial that this session take place in a friendly and comfortable setting. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre making two types of sessions available, to accommodate individual member preferences. You can choose between:

- having a conversation around existing open-source living in your GitHub account;
- receiving a series of small code challenges and walking through solving them.

## What to expect

- If you've chosen the code challenge scenario, you'll receive a series of small problems to solve using any programming language and IDE of your choice. They'll be increasing in difficulty, and you'll have about 40 minutes to solve as many as you can.
- If you've chosen the open-source code scenario, be ready for a 40 minute-or-so conversation around your project, its challenges and your implementation decisions. Make sure the code is fresh, relevant, beautiful, and representative for your skill level. You should be following best practices around linting, documenting, and testing. You should also have a solid Readme file. There‚Äôs a [Repo Housekeeping doc](https://github.com/telepat-io/code/blob/master/Practices/Keeping%20Beautiful%20Repos.md) on this topic in the North Library.
- The moderator will be helping you through and will ask you additional questions to highlight important aspects. You'll receive feedback and advice, and we'll publish an edited version of the session to your North profile. We'll preserve your anonymity in the process.


## How to Ace it

### Before the Session

- Be ready to present your favorite IDE screen via Google Hangouts.
- Pick a quiet and comfortable time interval, so you can perform well without interruption. Make sure your mic works.
- Have a diagram creation tool like draw.io ready, in case you need to draw up any ideas.
- Get some training using https://edabit.com/challenges problems.
- Practice. [HackerRank data](https://blog.hackerrank.com/introducing-cracking-the-coding-interview-tutorial-new-study-on-interview-practice/) indicates that:
    - developers with 2+ years of experience need to solve ~20 challenges to boost test performance by 50 percent;
    - junior developers with less than 2 years of experience need to solve 30 challenges to boost chances of passing by ~50 percent.
- Check out some strong examples here: https://interviewing.io/recordings.

### During the Session

- Think out loud. Describe the options you're considering, justify your actions while coding.
- Stress out best practices; even ones you know you're not following to save on time or for other reasons.
- Relax! This is a chance to learn and improve in a safe, friendly environment.
- It‚Äôs ok to Google or use any helping materials - just do what you would normally do to solve a problem. Avoid copy-pasting an entire solution you find on StackOverflow or elsewhere though, that‚Äôs kind of anti-climatic üòä.
- Make sure you properly understand the scope of the challenges. Don‚Äôt be afraid to ask clarification questions, it signals that you‚Äôre putting mental effort into uncovering potential complexity.

### After the Session - Continuous Practice

- Watch the [Cracking the Coding Interview Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI1t_8YX-ApvFsH-DaFmAmdJboAnbg08P).
- Read The [Algorithm Design Manual](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.471.4772&rep=rep1&type=pdf) by Steven S. Skiena
- An excellent primer on system design: https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer.
- Don‚Äôt neglect upgrading your language skills! If English is not your primary language, you should practice speaking it on a daily basis.
- Keep training using collections like:
    - https://edabit.com/challenges
    - https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/
    - http://www.programmr.com/exercises
    - https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/

    - https://codeforces.com/problemset (competitive programming, hosts regular competitions)
    - https://codier.io/ (frontend challenges)

Help us Improve

This all may be legitimate, but it is [not perfect](https://software.rajivprab.com/2019/07/27/hiring-is-broken-and-yours-is-too/). Code challenges are stressful and often times artificial. Not everyone has the time to work on open-source projects. Your performance on such sessions can be influenced by a number of factors independent of your skill level, such as your personality or your momentary affective state. There is bias and error within the process, and we‚Äôre aware of that. That‚Äôs why we rely on your feedback and ideas for making this better - just Slack Gabi or Andrei, or send any of us an email.
