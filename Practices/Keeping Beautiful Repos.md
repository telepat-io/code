    - Free for OSS: https://codeclimate.com/oss/ 
    - Free to run yourself: https://github.com/codeclimate/codeclimate and https://hub.docker.com/r/codeclimate/codeclimate/
- Setup a CI pipeline, commit test & build configuration to repo.
    - https://circleci.com/ and https://travis-ci.org/ are great free options.
    - GitLab has a [great CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/). GitHub has [actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).
- Never commit secrets!
    - Hook in https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets
    - Use [dotenv files](https://12factor.net/config).
- Leverage the [CODEOWNERS](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-code-owners) file.
- Setup [issue and PR templates](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests) (or [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/description_templates.html), if you’re on GitLab). Get inspiration from:
    - https://github.com/stevemao/github-issue-templates
    - https://github.com/devspace/awesome-github-templates
- Maintain a [CHANGELOG](https://changelog.md/) file. You can learn how to keep a good changelog [here](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and check out [this repo](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog) to read about conventional commits.


## Commit & Review Guidelines
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
- Be [consistent](https://xkcd.com/1296/).
- Some great guides on writing PRs:
    - https://www.braintreepayments.com/blog/effective-pull-requests-a-guide/
    - https://holgerfrohloff.de/best-practices-on-doing-pull-requests/
- Check out [Code Review guidelines](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/) from Google. Here’s [StackOverflow’s take](https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/09/30/how-to-make-good-code-reviews-better/).
- GitHub has a guide on [mastering issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).
- Use automation to improve your workflow on GitHub: https://github.com/probot/probot
- [Release](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository) functioning code regularly, while following [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) rules.


## Interacting with users
- It's important to talk to your current users and analyse the cons and pros of the application you are sharing.
- You should regularly check for new issues, assign them labels and assignees, and raise some yourself while developing. 
- It might be beneficial to expose your workflow by providing an online [Kanban board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board), for example through [Trello](https://trello.com/). You could also create a [Discord](https://discord.com) server or a [Slack](https://slack.com/) workspace and share the progress in a more casual manner.
- You should promote your project, for example by answering [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) questions using your application or sharing it with associated communities. Check out for example [this Python community](https://pythondiscord.com/) to share programs written in Python.
