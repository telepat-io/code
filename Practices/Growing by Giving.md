## Contributing to OSS
- Use this as an opportunity to:
    - Meet people who are interested in similar things
    - Find mentors and teach others
    - Build public artifacts that help you grow a reputation (and a career)
    - Learn people skills
- Be on the lookout for great projects to contribute to:
    - Use [this checklist](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#a-checklist-before-you-contribute) to evaluate projects.
    - Pick a project that you’re passionate about.
        - If it’s a larger project, great! That means your contribution will have a greater impact. Also, it shows that your work and your skills are validated by an established group of industry experts.
        - If it’s a smaller project, great! Work with the owners to setup [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/telepat-io/code/blob/master/Practices/Keeping%20Beautiful%20Repos.md#contributing-guidelines), if none are in place.
    - https://www.codetriage.com/ is a great discovery tool. Also, https://up-for-grabs.net.
    - https://github.com/lk-geimfari/awesomo is a great collection of cool projects.
    - You can search GitHub directly for good beginner issues you could more easily tackle:
        - https://github.com/search?q=label%3Afirst-timers-only&state=open&type=Issues
        - https://github.com/search?q=label%3Agood-first-issue&state=open&type=Issues
    - Use https://github.com/trending to find up-and-coming projects where you can become an early contributor.
- Subscribe to the project’s mailing list, Slack, Gitter, or any public community.
- Go through `CONTRIBUTORS.md`, `README.md` and the project wiki
- You can always help improve documentation.
- Check out the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).
- There’s a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to contributing [here](http://www.contribution-guide.org/#). GitHub also has a [great one](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).
- In some cases, you can get paid for contributing: https://opensource.guide/getting-paid/.


## Creating OSS
- Not sure what to create?
    - Think of something you’re passionate about. What sort of software does that thing use? Is there any aspect that can be automated with software?
    - Look back to your coding experience. What made you think “I wish there was a better way to do this”? That could be a library you make to save others from headaches.
    - Check out these repositories for open-source project ideas:
        - https://github.com/open-source-ideas/open-source-ideas
        - https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas
    - The Linux Foundation has a great article on getting started. Also, here’s an OSS project launch checklist: https://www.linuxfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Open_Source_Project_Launch_Checklist.pdf
- Check out the North guidelines for repo housekeeping.
- Here’s a guide to getting [financial support](https://github.com/nayafia/lemonade-stand) for your project.
- Promote your project on Reddit, DEV.to, Hacker News, Product Hunt, Hashnode etc.


## Contributing to StackOverflow
- Be on the lookout for new questions in your areas of experience. Here’s an example link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/javascript+or+python
- Look for simple questions you can answer quickly for quick rep points, but also choose a more advanced topic you specialize in that’s not so popular, and monitor questions on that topic as well.
- Hunt the bounties - prioritize questions that have bounties attached, as they tend to get more attention, and you’ll get more rep for answering them.
- Setup watched tags and ignored tags.
- Format your answers - use headers and lists. Link to official references or documentation.
- Give a quick, tldr answer first, then go on to elaborate.
- Post your answer even if the question already has two or three lower-quality answers. Make yours shine.
- Be humble, thorough and fair.
- More great advice [here](https://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2009/02/17/answering-technical-questions-helpfully/), from [Jon Skeet](https://stackoverflow.com/users/22656/jon-skeet).
