## Telepat North Handbook

### Ranks & Benefits
- North membership has four ranks. Each rank grants a member access to a distinct set of benefits, as follows:
  - The **CADET** rank. Cadets are coders that are new to the field, don't have extensive experience, or need to expand or improve their professional skills to advance in rank. Cadets get access to the North community and can attend workshops and special events.
  - The **ASPIRANT** rank. Aspirants are outstanding coders with substantial professional experience, good language skills, and an ambition to improve continually. Aspirants receive:
    - Access to the North community;
    - Access to Workshops and Special Events;
    - Access to books, courses and certifications via the [O'Reilly Learning Platform](https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/features.html);
    - Three one-to-one personal coaching sessions with our senior members.
  - The **STAR** rank. Stars are outstanding coders that have proven their skills and determination to improve and grow. Stars get all Aspirant benefits listed above, plus:
    - Access to top remote work opportunities via the Telepat network;
    - The North Mystery Swag Box, shipped internationally;
    - Access to mentorship sessions with industry professionals.
  - The **SENIOR** rank. Seniors have proven their abilities within real-world, remote work projects, identified via North. Seniors get perpetual, non-limited access to all benefits listed above.

### Commitments & Ranking Up
- North members of all ranks commit to honor [the Code](https://github.com/telepat-io/code).
- North members are skilled enough to efficiently communicate in technical language with people from around the world. Members are proficient in English.
- For every received benefit, members will contribute the sum of their gained knowledge and experience back to the community.
  - Post a message on the `#preach` channel about how your club benefit impacted you:
    - How did the perk (book, course, subscription, etc.) make you better?
    - What are the most important things you've learned? Share some quotes or some learnings.
    - What tips do you have for other club members that might be interested in the same benefit?
  - Don't lurk. Finish reading books, attend the courses, do the hard work to become a better you. Then `#preach.`
  - Be present on the North Slack and ready to share knowledge with your peers that ask for help.
  - Apply learnings to update your North 360 Profile.
- **CADETS** will strive to reach the ASPIRANT rank. There are no set minimum requirements or timeframe for the transition, but Cadets will generally be expected to improve and extend their professional experience, by:
  - Working towards becoming an expert in at least one domain (technology/language/tool);
  - Knowing and following all modern best practices in this chosen domain;
  - Solidifying their GitHub profile with projects relevant to the selected domain;
  - Gathering more work experience within various teams and projects;
  - Improving their English language skills.
- **ASPIRANTS** will strive to reach STAR rank. To do this, they must accumulate **at least 60 experience points**, via the following possible activities/projects:
  - **North Workshop & Special Event attendance**: *3 points per event*, capped to 24 points. Events are ongoing, regular activities, and are advertised via Slack and email bulletins. Note: some events are mandatory for ranking up.
  - **Interview Simulator**: a maximum of *10 points*, as awarded by the interviewer. Note: this activity is mandatory for ranking up. Read additional details [here](#the-interview-simulator).
  - **GitHub Showcase Projects**: *10 points per project*, capped to 20 points (2 projects). Read additional details [here](#github-showcase-projects).
  - **Coding Skill Assessments**: *5 points per assessment*, capped to 30 points (6 assessments). We accept any legitimate assessment that we can verify, including [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/94427), [TestDome](https://www.testdome.com/for-jobseekers), [SkillValue](https://skillvalue.com/) and others.
  - **Original Content** - professional articles, blog posts or videos: *5 points per post*, capped to 10 points (2 posts).
  - **Open Source Contributions**: *10 points per contribution*, capped to 20 points (2 contributions).
  - **A Personal Video Introduction**: *10 points*. Read additional details [here](#the-personal-video-intro).
  - **Additional Tests** available via the 360 profile: *3 points per completed test*, uncapped.
- **STARS** will strive to reach the SENIOR rank, by onboarding with a remote work opportunity identified via North.

### The Interview Simulator
- Training for interviews and coding challenges? North provides a sandbox environment for members to practice and learn. To rank up from ASPIRANT to STAR, each member needs to attend this activity.
- The interview will be held by one or more North senior members, who will also grade it at the end and provide feedback and advice throughout the session.
- Each session consists of two parts:
  - The first 20-30 minutes consist of a conversation based on behavioral questions, plus a short 2-minute member intro: how you got into programming, your passions, the achievements you are proud of, the way you view your career evolving.
  - The last 30-40 minutes consist of asserting the member's coding & reasoning capabilities. Members have a choice between receiving a quick challenge to solve using any IDE and any language of their choice, or preparing a GitHub repo that's representative for their work and current skill level. The objective is to hear members explain/present their work, show us the critical highlights or the significant challenges that they've faced.
- The entire session will be video recorded. We'll select top highlights together, and publish the video inserts to the member's North profile. This will be invaluable to the companies members will pitch down the road.
- Members also receive a link to the full recording to review and consider ways they could improve. 
- If members are not happy with their initial session, they can record updates incorporating interviewer feedback and re-submit them.

### GitHub Showcase Projects
- We encourage members always to have one or more public, open-source projects featured on their GitHub profile, to showcase their abilities and stand out from the crowd.
- The project code should be representative of the member's current experience and skill level. This means that the code should be revisited and updated at least yearly to make sure it reflects the most modern paradigms and best practices.
- The code should be readable and extensively documented inline.
- The project should have an extensive README file, outlying:
  - A *raison d'etre* - what problem does the project solve, what is the target audience;
  - A procedure for installation;
  - A "Getting Started" section with quick usage examples;
  - Full API documentation - inline within the Markdown file, using GitHub Wikis, or, preferably, a link to external docs, automatically generated from code.
  - Notes on setting up the project in development mode and contributing to the project;
  - Notes on submitting issues;
  - Any applicable [shields](https://shields.io/).
- Particular attention should be paid to commit and branching practices. Have granular, well-written commits, use semantic versioning, create Releases.
- The project should incorporate a CI pipeline (e.g., Travis or CircleCI).
- The project should make use of automated tests, and aim for 80% or above code coverage.

### The Personal Video Intro
- We encourage members to record and publish a short introduction video about themselves.
- This can be hosted on Youtube or any other hosting platform, public or unlisted.
- The video should highlight your professional experience and achievements, as well as offer a glimpse into your personality and goals.
- Ideally, the video should be around 5 minutes in length.
- Make sure that there's plenty of light on your face and in the background. Make sure the background is neutral, clean, and free of any distracting personal items.
- Wear softer, solid colors - avoid distracting attention from your face.
- If you wear glasses, make sure that they're glare-proof, so there's no reflection.

### Recruitment & Onboarding
- Membership is free and invite-based, with batches of ten to twenty invites being issued periodically.
- Members can recommend persons they judge worthy of North membership.
- Candidates that choose to pursue membership will need to read the Code and have a 30-minute video call with the North crew. The talk will revolve around:
  - drive, motivations, goals
  - vision on the Code
  - professional skills
  - communication skills
- After candidates get their admission email, we'll:
  - ask them to read this handbook thoroughly
  - work with them on setting up their North 360 profile
- As soon as the profile is set up, we'll introduce the new member to our Slack community.

### Etiquette
Members should:
- Observe the `#code-updates` and `#handbook-updates` channels for essential updates to document sources.
- Use `#overflow` to ask for technical support.
- Use `#random` for funny or personal messages.
- Use `#preach` to distribute knowledge. Any great professional content you want to share also belongs here.
- Use `#general` to post notifications and messages that don't fall into categories above to the entire community.

Members are expected to refrain from posting advertisements or job opportunities to any channel.
