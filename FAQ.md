### Why North?
> Your career is your responsibility. It is not your employer's responsibility to make sure you are marketable. It is not your employer's responsibility to train you, or to send you to conferences, or to buy you books. These things are your responsibility. Woe to the software developer who entrusts his career to his employer. *(Robert C. Martin - The Clean Coder)*

Telepat North's members are driven by the knowledge that professional growth is a personal responsibility.

The club provides resources and support to members on their continuous growth path. It aims to emulate the dynamics of a startup accelerator within a community of exceptional coders by investing in the accumulation and distribution of knowledge.
